Hi all,

Below you will find the link to today’s whiteboarding questions. Click the link that is in the column that has your name.

Spend ten minutes reviewing the questions you will ask. Each candidate should have about 35 minutes to answer both questions. Give yourself about 5 to 10 minutes to fill out the scorecard.

Whiteboarding should be finished around 11:00am. If you happen to finish early, feel free to get started on the day’s work.

Here are the assignments:

Have fun!
